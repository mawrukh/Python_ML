# BART Model Text Summarizer

This project is a text summarization app built using Streamlit and the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model from Hugging Face. The app allows users to input any text and generates a concise summary, leveraging BART's powerful natural language processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Pretrained BART Model**: Utilizes `facebook/bart-large-cnn` from Hugging Face for summarization.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing a simple text area for input and a button to generate summaries.
- **Efficient Summarization**: Capable of handling long texts and producing summaries quickly.

## How It Works

1. **Input Text**: Users can enter text in the provided text area within the app.
2. **Generate Summary**: Upon clicking the "Summarize" button, the app processes the input text using the BART model.
3. **Display Summary**: The summarized version of the input text is displayed on the screen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
